### First Templates are available now!

Those template a ready do use


Presentation
================================

This repository is split in multiple folders


Locals
---------------
Those are static report which will generate HTML pages when they are imported.
Those pages can the be opened in any web browsers.

Those reports are tutorials in order to explain how to use the components / modules. 

The Javascript external dependencies will not be downloaded an they will be retrieved on the fly by the browser

Dashboards
---------------
Simple Dashboard using mutliple different components.

Websites
---------------
Simple reports with a look and feel of common website. Those are just examples in order to help starting a project

Interactives
---------------
Those are reports which require a back end server to be fully working. Those reports are in two parts:
    - the front end one which will generate the HTML content (including CSS and JavaScript)
    - the back end part running on a server


Compatibility
================================

Epik is compatible with the most common Web Python Frameworks (Flask and Django).
By default, the server package embeds a Flask app as it is easier to install and ready to use.

The Framework can be included within a Jupyter or JupyterLab project. But this will lead to some limitations - for example Ajax and Socket will not be available.

It  can also be integrated to a pure Javascript Framework like Angular or NodeJs as it will only render JS packages

Coming Soon
================================

Please get in touch if there is any feature you feel Epyk-UI needs.
